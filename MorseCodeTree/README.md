# Morse Code Tree
Programmer: Duane Cressman
Date Created: March 2019
This program shows how all the letters and digits are represented in Morse code. The Morse code for each letter/digit is stored in code.dat. The program is written in C++ and uses the PD Curses library to control the output to the screen. 
The code for each letter/digit can be read by beginning at “Start” and following the tree down to that letter/digit. Each left turn represents a ‘.’ and each right turn represents a ‘-‘.
