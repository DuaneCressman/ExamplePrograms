This project is a Universal Windows Platform application that emulated the classic sliding tile game. To play the game, the user can use a photo taken on their webcam, or file system. Default numbers can be used as well. Then for game play the user can tap/click or slide the tiles to get them in the correct order. 
This projects heavily implements object-oriented programming techniques. It also uses XAML to format the user interface. This application is also compatible with touch screen displays.
Visual Studio 2019 was used to build this application and can currently be played in Visual Studio.
